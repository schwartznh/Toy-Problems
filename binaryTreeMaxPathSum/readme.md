# Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
Source/Test: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any node sequence from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

## Example 1:

![Word Search Example 1](assets/exx1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
```

## Example 2:

![Word Search Example 2](assets/exx2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
```

### Constraints:

- ``` The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 3 * 104]```
- ``` -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000```
